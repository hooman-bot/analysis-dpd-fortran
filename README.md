# Analysis of trajecoteries from DPD simulations, in FORTRAN.

This is a repository of some fortran code, used to analyse some fluid properties from coarse grained molecular dynamic simulations, Dissapative Particle Dynamics (DPD). LAMMPS was used to generate the evolution of the system, and the outputted trajectory files are used in this study. 

#this is just a test for moi see if smth ha ha happens.
